To do List
1. Find data
2. Read chapter 2 of Advances in PCA
3. Learn more about R packages.

Look into combinations of SPCA and KPCA. Would the transformations applied during KPCA make PCs too hard to interpret or could we find meaningful interpretations of a small number of variables under a transformation.

KPCA works best with large amount of data fairly evenly distributed along the manifold.
